Task 1: Implement a method that reads a text file (file.txt) containing phone numbers and prints the valid phone numbers to the console. Valid phone numbers should match one of two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx.

Task 2: Read a text file (file.txt) containing user information, convert it into a list of User objects, and write them to a new file (user.json) in JSON format.

Task 3: Write a method that calculates the frequency of each word in a text file (words.txt). The file contains lowercase words separated by spaces, with words potentially separated by multiple spaces or line breaks.

Note: The examples provided demonstrate the expected behavior and desired outcomes for each task.
